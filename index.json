We here introduce the fully genetic encapsulin/cargo system of Quasibacillus thermotolerans (Qt), which in combination with the recently characterized encapsulin system from Myxococcus xanthus (Mx) enables multiplexed gene reporter imaging via conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in mammalian cells. Cryo-electron reconstructions revealed that the Qt encapsulin shell self-assembles to nanospheres with T = 4 icosahedral symmetry and a diameter of ∼43 nm harboring two putative pore regions at the 5-fold and 3-fold axes. We also found that upon heterologous expression in mammalian cells, the native cargo is autotargeted to the inner surface of the shell and exhibits ferroxidase activity leading to efficient intraluminal iron biomineralization, which enhances cellular TEM contrast. We furthermore demonstrate that the two differently sized encapsulins of Qt and Mx do not intermix and can be robustly differentiated by conventional TEM via a deep learning classifier to enable automated multiplexed EM gene reporter imaging.","tags":null,"title":"Iron-Sequestering Nanocompartments as Multiplexed Electron Microscopy Gene Reporters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steffen Schneider","Alexei Baevski","Ronan Collobert","Michael Auli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554940800,"objectID":"6889c0a45ff84de28fc17a26b5740fff","permalink":"https://stes.io/publication/wav2vec/","publishdate":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wav2vec/","section":"publication","summary":"We explore unsupervised pre-training for speech recognition by learning representations of raw audio. wav2vec is trained on large amounts of unlabeled audio data and the resulting representations are then used to improve acoustic model training.

We propose to train a deep neural network to learn synchronized patterns between biosignals from two modalities by transcribing signals from one modality into their expected, simultaneous or synchronized signal in another modality. Thus, instead of measuring the degree of synchrony between signals from different modalities using traditional linear and non-linear measures, we simplify this problem into the problem of measuring the degree of synchrony between the real and the synthesized signals from the same modality using the traditional measures. Desynchronization detection is then achieved by applying a threshold function to the estimated degree of synchrony. We demonstrate the approach with the detection of eye-movement artifacts in a public sleep dataset and compare the detection performance with traditional approaches.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Desynchronization Detection in Biosignals","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506902400,"objectID":"ebffdccedee12b6aa09688afda9ffc3f","permalink":"https://stes.io/project/neubtracker/","publishdate":"2017-10-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neubtracker/","section":"project","summary":"An Imaging Platform for Neurobehavioral Research","tags":["social","blog"],"title":"NeuBtracker","type":"project"},{"authors":["Panagiotis Symvoulidis","Antonella Lauri","Anca Stefanoiu","Michele Cappetta","Steffen Schneider","Hongbo Jia","Anja Stelzl","Maximilian Koch","Carlos Cruz Perez","Ahne Myklatun","Sabine Renninger","Andriy Chmyrov","Tobias Lasser","Wolfgang Wurst","Vasilis Ntziachristos","Gil G Westmeyer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506902400,"objectID":"4b989b9aba5a2a913440ec5844c59fa3","permalink":"https://stes.io/publication/neubtracker/","publishdate":"2017-10-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neubtracker/","section":"publication","summary":"A long-standing objective in neuroscience has been to image distributed neuronal activity in freely behaving animals.

This work provides a fully automated, end-to-end learning-based setup for normalizing histological stains, which considers the texture context of the tissue. We introduce Feature Aware Normalization, which extends the framework of batch normalization in combination with gating elements from Long Short-Term Memory units for normalization among different spatial regions of interest. By incorporating a pretrained deep neural network as a feature extractor steering a pixelwise processing pipeline, we achieve excellent normalization results and ensure a consistent representation of color and texture. The evaluation comprises a comparison of color histogram deviations, structural similarity and measures the color volume obtained by the different methods.","tags":null,"title":"Context-based Normalization of Histological Stains using Deep Convolutional Features","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501545600,"objectID":"840e8a3581f6f6e6e4ccbb4154076e34","permalink":"https://stes.io/project/biomodels/","publishdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/biomodels/","section":"project","summary":"Establishing fruitful collaborations between biologists, computer scientists and mathematicians in a yearly one-week retreat.","tags":["social","blog"],"title":"Biomodels Retreat","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"95c81f8b867a411b7995f0e76c5e7105","permalink":"https://stes.io/project/msne/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/msne/","section":"project","summary":"M.Sc.
